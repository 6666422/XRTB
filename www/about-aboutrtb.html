<p>Mobile Real Time Bidding (RTB) is at the intersection of two of the fastest growing areas 
within digital advertising as a whole, programmatic buying and mobile advertising. 
Market intelligence firms such as Forrester, IDC, and Parks Associates have all 
been monitoring the growth in online RTB and made various estimates on its current size. 
Using round numbers and comparing the available estimates, RTB as a whole is approximately
a $3 Billion industry in the U.S. in 2013 and forecasted to grow to approximately 
$9 Billion by 2016. Worldwide spending via RTB may reach $14 Billion by 2016. 
Meanwhile, according to eMarketer, U.S. mobile advertising revenue will 
grow 77.3 percent from $4.11 Billion in 2012 to $7.29 Billion by yearâ€™s end.</p>
