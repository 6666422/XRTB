<p>Take the example of a sports brand looking to advertise to male sports enthusiasts who like to be on 
the cutting edge with their sports footwear purchases. In the past advertisers and their agencies 
would define an audience they were looking to reach, for instance, Male, 24-36, sports enthusiasts 
living in urban areas, with college educations, and a household income of $50,000 or more. Next a 
media budget would be allocated and a media planner would develop a media plan by talking to a 
large number of media outlets: television stations, radio stations, magazine publishers, 
billboard companies, online web sites, and more recently mobile app publishers or mobile 
ad networks, etc. The media planner would need to understand which media outlets were targeted to their 
desired audience as well as the cost, usually in Cost per Mille (CPM- cost per thousand impressions), of
 taking out advertising space in these media outlets. The media planner would divide up the budget 
 for the media plan among the media outlets they thought would be most successful in reaching 
 the desired audience and sign insertion orders (IOs) to buy media from the media outlets. 
 Hopefully from the brief outline of this process in the paragraph above, itâ€™s become clear 
 that this is an incredibly inefficient process.</p>
