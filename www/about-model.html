<p>Over the past 8 years media buyers have looked to become more efficient, at least
with their purchases of online media through RTB. Web site publishers now “broadcast” 
the availability of eyeballs (impressions) looking at their web site in real time and 
conduct auctions on exchanges (not dissimilar from stock exchanges such as the NYSE) 
for media buyers to buy this media in real time via cloud-based software that is 
programmed to “listen” for these impressions (Demand Side Platforms or “DSPs”). 
In some cases the publisher will identify the name of the web site associated 
with the impression, such as Sports Illustrated or ESPN (in our example above), 
but in other cases they will not identify the name of the web site and instead append 
information about the audience looking at their web site in the bid request that 
is sent to auction on the exchange. Trading desks within advertising agencies 
program their DSPs to “listen” for desired impressions and make decisions in 
real time based on their media budgets at any given time and metrics about 
how many conversion events such as clicks on a web site banner ad or online 
purchases are taking place as a result of the auctions they are winning.</p>
