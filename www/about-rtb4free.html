<p>RTB4FREE was written by two engineers with a passion for open source, and mobile advertising. RTB as a
protocol is pretty simple, but the devil is in the details. We try to push all the details in RTB outside
of the server itself using a robust but simple publish-subscribe mechanism. We want RTB4FREE to be as
lightweight as possible, but still useful for understanding the issues in fielding a system like this.</p>
<p>The authors have experience in several RTB platforms, built in Nodejs, C++ and JAVA. Also we have
considerable experience in fielding large RTB infrastructures and dealing with performance issues. If you
would like to get more information please feel free to contact us.</p>
