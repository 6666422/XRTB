<p>With the huge growth in adoption of smartphones and tablets over the past few years, thereâ€™s 
been an enormous shift in how digital content is viewed. Consumers who previously performed 
searches and browsed the web on their PCs are now doing 20-50% of this activity on their 
mobile phones or tablets, even when their PCs are close by! Tablets are now outselling PCs. 
Because of this shift, web site publishers are seeing declines in their online advertising 
and scrambling to sell more mobile and tablet advertising to make up for their losses from 
desktop web advertising revenue. Even giant Google, announced as part of their earnings 
announcement earlier this month, that they are susceptible to this trend. Meanwhile 
advertisers who have observed the same trend are eager to reach their target audience on 
their smartphone or tablet screens. This creates the perfect storm for Mobile RTB.</p>
