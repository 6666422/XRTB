<h1>Creating Your Ad Markup in RTB4FREE</h1>    
<p>Of critical importance, of course, is to construct what your ad markup will be on the web page when user's web 
browser loads the web publisher's page. In the case of VAST video, that's real simple, because you are just 
providing a VAST XML document in the ADM. And likewise
for native content your ADM is constructed from the native ad parts. T
he hardest part is actually dealing with banner ads.</p>
<p>In general an RTB based display ad has 3 parts: 1. The anchor, 2. the pixel image, 3, the click address. It might look
like this:</p>
<h2>Sample Anchor Structure</h2>
<xmp>
	<a href="your-ad-goes-here">
		<img src='your-pixel-tracker-goes-here" width=1 height=1>
		<img src='your-display.gif'>
	</a>
</xmp>
In this tutorial you will see how the configuration file (Campaigns/payday.json in the demo) and the creative defined in your 
campaign (in database.json and loaded into REDIS) are used to construct advertisements.</p>
<h2>The Template</h2>
<p>In your campaign, the <i>template object</i> defines how you will construct your display ad, The construction is quite
flexible, but it can be difficult to get the structure right, so we will go through it piece by piece. Here is the structure of the
<i>template</i> object (you can see examples in database.json):
<xmp>
    "template" : {
          "default" : "<a href='your specifcation goes here' ></a>",
          "exchange" : {
          "nexage" : "<a href='nexage specific stuff here''></a>"
      }
    },
</xmp>
<p>As we go through this tutorial, we will be building up the structure of the <i>Sample Anchor Structure</i>, from above.</p>
<p>What happens on forming a bid request, the ad markup can be generated based on what exchange the bid came in on. Normally
you would want to specify the same markup, but if you need to specify a different markup, then you can specify it as
key/value pair in the "exchange" map of the template object. For the example we will use just the default. So
starting off our template looks like:
<pre>
 "template" : {
          "default" : "",
          "exchange" : {}
      }
    },
</pre>
<h2>Pixel, Click and Redirects?</h2>
<p>The next step is to determine if you are going to let RTB4FREE handle the click/redirect 
processing and the pixel notification.</p>
<p><B>Pixel</B> - The pixel is nothing more than <img> tag in the markup with the src attrbite of course causing a 1x1
'invisible' pixel to load with web page. In this manner you can know for certain that your ad was loaded in the user's
device. If you get a lot of wins but your pixels don't fire, then you have a problem or you are getting hit with robots.</p>

<p><b>Click/Redirect</b> - The Click/redirect is the href of the anchor. If you let RTB4FREE handle the click, then what
it will do is process the click when the user hits the image. When RTB4FREE processes the click, it does 2 things. First, 
it creates a 'click' record and publishes it on the 'clicks' REDIS channgel, And second, the RTB4FREE server will redirect
the web user to the actual ad. So, if RTB4FREE does the clicktrack, you will follow a specific form. If you send the click
to some other location, you will need to format the field as you see fit.</p>

<p>RTB4FREE can handle the pixel processing for you. It generates a 'pixel record which is published on the 
'clicks' REDIS channel. The format of the img tag might look like:

<h3>Let RTB4FREE Handle Pixels</h3>
In this section we will set it up so RTB4FREE handles the clicks and pixels. First the Pixel. This is a fixed
form that must look like this in the "default" value:

<xmp>
	<a href=""
		<img src='{pixel_url}/{pub}/{ad_id}/{bid_id}/${AUCTION_PRICE}/{creative_id}' height='1' width='1'>
	</a>
</xmp>
<p>You can see macro substitutions will be made by the {} specification. The ${AUCTION_PRICE} is a standard RTB
macro, and will cause the markup to be replaced with the actual price of the auction being subbed in.</p>
<p>The other macros are subbed by RTB4FREE and define the actual pixel_url being used, the campaign id, the bid request id, and
the id of the actual creative, respectively. In this manner key information is passed to the RTB4FREE server
when the markup is loaded into the user's browser</p>
<p><i>If you are handling the clicks, set it up however you need to. Or if you don't track pixels, just don't specify this
img tag</i></p>
<p>Here are the RTB4FREE standard macro substitutions:</p>

                <pre>
        {ad_id}                 Substituted from the campaign id.
        {bid_id}                Substituted from the bid's object id field.
        {campaign_ad_height}    Substituted from campaign creatives height
        {campaign_ad_price}     Substituted from the campaign's price.
        {campaign_ad_width}     Substituted from campaign creatives width
        {campaign_forward_url}  Substitured from the campaign creatives forward url
        {campaign_image_url}	Substituted from the campain creative's image url
        {creative_id}           Substituted from campaign's creative's id.
        {pub}                   Substituted from the bid request exchange.
        {site_id}               Substituted from the bid request's site id.
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Let RTB4FREE Handle the Click></h3>
<p>When you let RTB4FREE handle the click it means you will be setting href of the anchor to an endpoint on
the RTB4FREE server, where it will record the click, and then redirects the web browser to the actual ad. The basic form is:
<pre>
	href="redict_info?url=frward_info"
</pre>
</p>
<p>For the same of argument, let's say your ad is at <i>http://bigco.com/coolproducts/product-123.html</i>.
The first part of the href is to set up the link to RTB4FREE to handle the click. This will look like:</p>
<xmp>
	<a href='{redirect_url}/{ad_id}/{pub}/{bid_id}?url={campaign_forward_url}'>
</xmp>
<p>
The forward url is defined in the campaign (see database.json for example) in the attribute called <i>forwardurl</i>. An 
example is shown below:
<pre>
    "creatives": [
	{
	 	"forwardurl" : "http://rtb4free:8080/contact.html?{site_id}&adid={ad_id}&crid={creative_id}",
	 	...
	}
	]
</pre>
<p>Here you can see the forward url is set to contact page (the ad). It will be passing ad id and creative id</p> This is the
address that RTB4FREE will redirct to - which is serving the ad.</p>
<p>The {redirect_url} is defined in the configuration file (in the example setup Campaigns/payday.json) in the app objhect. Here's a
snippet of what that looks like:
<pre>
	{ 
		...
	 	app: {
	 		"redirect-url": "http://rtb4free.com:8080/redirect
	 		...
	 	}
	 }
}
</pre>
As you can see, the href goes to <i>http://rtb4free.com:8080/redirect//ad_id/pub_id/bid_id?url=....</i> with the machro subs done
for the values as appropriate. The url= then points to the forward url of where the RTB4FREE server sends the redirect (again with
all the appropriate substritions performed). This is just the standard way to have RTB4FREE handle the click and then do the redirect and click</p>
<p>If you wanted to bypass all this and send the ad straight on through, then for the href you use:
<pre>
	href="http//bigco.com<b>YOUR_STRUCTURE_GOES_HERE_INCLUDING_MACRO_SUBS</b>"
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>So, here is a real template setting:
<xmp>
{
	...
	"template": {
 		"default" : "<a href='{redirect_url}/{ad_id}/{pub}/{bid_id}?url={campaign_forward_url}'>
 				<img src='{pixel_url}/{pub}/{ad_id}/{bid_id}/${AUCTION_PRICE}/{creative_id}' height='1' width='1'></img>
 				<img src='{campaign_image_url}' height='{campaign_ad_height}' width='{campaign_ad_width}'></img></a>",
 		"exchanges" {}
 	},
 	...
 }
</xmp>
You can clearly see the anchor href uses RTB4FREE for clicj and redirection, the first image is the pixel notification,
and the second image is the actual display ad</p>
<p>Here's a sample of what would actually delivered to the exchange as ad markup:
<xmp>
<a href='http://rtb4free.com:8080/redirect/ben:payday/nexage/f490a080-3a48-e718-ec58-dd63738ffe5a?url=http://rtb4free.com:8080/contact.html?99201amp;adid=ben:payday&amp;crid=23skiddoo'>
    <img height='1' src='http://rtb4free.com:8080/pixel/nexage/ben:payday/f490a080-3a48-e718-ec58-dd63738ffe5a/${AUCTION_PRICE}/23skiddoo' width='1'>
    <img height='50.0' src='http://rtb4free.com:8080/images/320x50.jpg?adid=ben:payday&amp;bidid=f490a080-3a48-e718-ec58-dd63738ffe5a' width='320.0'>
</a>
