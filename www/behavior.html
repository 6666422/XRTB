<h2>Making mobile impressions worth more</h2>
Do not let anyone ever tell you there are no cookies on mobile. Even third-party cookies can be dropped and 
read depending on which mobile browser is being employed (ahem, Chrome). For example, when you enter login 
information on a mobile website, how do you think that site remembers you when you stroll back later in your 
session? Old-fashioned (namely first-party) cookie power.</p>
<p>The mobile cookie bears more than a passing resemblance to its desktop cousin: it’s a retrievable 
token or ID that’s dropped in HTML5 local storage. However, on iOS and Android, cookies are <i>sandboxed</i>; 
they can be used in the browser, but they’re walled off from apps. An app can employ a cookie by briefly 
opening and closing a browser window, but the information stored remains solely in that specific app’s 
purview. That means digital media players who want to use mobile cookies for tracking and targeting across 
mobile web and apps in a manner similar to desktop are plain out of luck.</p>
<p>"Mobile inventory is less valuable than desktop because it is very difficult to build audience in 
mobile – we simply have no identification layer," say James Lamberti GM and VP of AdTruth. 
"We need the ability to speak to advertisers and confidently say, <i>Here is my mobile inventory, 
here are my heavy travelers, here are males 18 to 25, here luxury brand buyers, etc.</i>"</p>
<p>One recent analysis of a large ad network showed MRAID-enhanced units claimed an 80% share of exchange spend, 
and average CPMs increased from $0.81 to $0.89; non-MRAID-enabled units dropped from $0.62 to $0.53. Also in the 
report: demand for interstitials has substantially outpaced banners in bid depth and win rate.

<p>MRAID is great for apps but what about mobile browser users? Unless the exchange sends you the browser cookie you
pretty much have to stick to location and device type data. This is a real problem in web based mobile advertising.</p>
