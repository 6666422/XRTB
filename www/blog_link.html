            <p>Fraud in the on-line ad business is rampant. There are 100s of "ghost sites" that offer ad inventory to real time 
            bidding exchanges. These ad impressions exist because botnets are creating fake ads and clicks. You need to protect your RTB system from ad
            fraud, otherwise you are just throwing money away.</p>

            <p>Native advertising is a type of online advertising that matches the form and function of the platform 
            on which it appears. An example native ad is an article written by an advertiser to promote their product, 
            but using the same form as an article written by the editorial staff of the actual web site.</p>
            <p>Native content advertising is all the rage now, but it work with RTB? Check 
            <a id="display1" href="native.html" target='_blank'> here</a> for an in depth study of how
            RTB4FREE (and RTB in general) will support native content.</p>

            <p>Got side tracked putting the private exchange up to implement support for Video RTB, along with Banner ad support.
            Video is actually not that hard to implement in RTB4FREE, the main difference being the format of the ADM response object
            needs to be formatted in the appropriate manner. The real work will be in your formatting of the ADM to properly reflect
            the format of the video protocol you will be using.</p>

            <p>Part of the magic of RTB is the Exchange. We are putting together a JAVA 1.8 implementation of an RTB private
            exchange. With this exchange you can solicit bids for advertisements in sample web pages, and through the
            exchange, RTB4FREE will bid on those requests. Use the private exchange code to implement your own RTB exchange and

            <p>Hey it would be nice to know what the capabilities of the handset the user has when you are about
            to bid on a placement. Problem is this information is not available in the bid request. Instead
            if you want to know the device screen size you have to figure it out from the UA (user agent)
            field of the bid request - then look it up in a database. To find out how this is done with RTB4FREE
            and how to create campaigns that utilize this extra capability

            <p>The majority of RTB ads for mobile is banner ads. But make no mistake about it, banner ads 'suck' to put it mildly. Mobile users click 
            on .01 percent of all impressions served. And of those clicks, 50% of those are mistakes. The RTB4FREE bidder is being built starting with
            display (banner) ads; but it will incorporate other media in a future release - most importantly, video. Read here for why banner ads suck: <a href="http://blog.appsfire.com/mobile-ads-suck-whats-next/">Why Mobile Ads Suck?"</a></p>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">January 31, 2015 by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ben-faul/3/963/a56">Ben</a></p>

            <p>We just got the domain registered, the Amazon instance, and the RTB engine installed on the instance. The web site is in the initial
            phase of operation. At this point we have the bidder located on the web site. The web site
            is not yet complete, but we are making great progress. Check back in two weeks and we should have
            our act together.</p>
            <h2>What This is All About</h2>
            <p>This is another open source RTB system. What's different about this one is that all the pieces are here
            for a full service RTB - the engine, the campaign management and the user console. The RTB is written
            in JAVA, the adminsitrative parts are written completely in HTML and JavaScript. The system is designed to be very modular
            and you should be able to stand up your own version of the system without too much trouble.<p>
            <p>Although we are providing you with the pieces, you can interchange your database and user interfaces with our
            components very easily. This is because all communications between the functional modules is done through a well
            defined, simple publish subscribe user interface.
           
            <h3>Components</h3>
            <p>The components of the RTB4FREE system are:</p>
           
            <ul>
              <li>RTB bidding engine in JAVA</li>
              <li>HTML/Javascript Campaign Administration System (replace with your provisioning system)</li>
              <li>REDIS based publish/subscribe network</li>
              <li>Simple file-based database for campaign management (replace with your DBMS)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Play with the RTB system here on this site to learn about RTB, or download the components from
            Github. The component parts are all modularized on the first page of the web site.</p>
