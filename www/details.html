<h1>RTB4FREE Bidder</h1>
<i>(NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS)</i><br>
<p>A Real Time Broker (RTB) 2.2 bidding engine written in Java 1.8</p>

The RTB4FREE project contains 3 major components: 
<ul>
	<li>Real Time Bidding engine</li>
	<li>Simulator for sending test bids</li>
	<li>Administration system for campaign definition</li>
</ul>
<p>
This project is for those fairly familiar with RTB. With a basic understanding of RTB, this project will get you
up and running with a commercial grade bidder in a short period of time.
</p>
A production bidding enterprise would most likely require multiple bidding engines running behind a firewall. This project
does not provide NGINX or AWS Load Balancer (or similar) infrastructure for this, you will need to tailor the 
administration of the XRTB to deal with these production issues. The XRTB comes out of the box ready to run in
a multi-server bidding farm, you just need to lash it up and administer it.</p>

<h1>BUILDING THE SYSTEM</h1>
<p>You will need ANT, JAVA 1.8, JACKSON, JETTY, GSON and REDIS installed to build the system. The libraries required are already placed in the ./libs directory</p>
If you use Eclipse or some other IDE, make your project and include the ./libs directory.</p>Note, there is a .gitignore file included.
<p>
Now use ant to build the system:
</p>
$ant
<p>----> Will create ./libs/xrtb.jar    -- Which is the jar file of the project.</p>
<p>$ant javadoc</p>
<p>----> Will create <a target="_blank" href="javadoc/index.html">javadoc</a> documents in the ./javadoc directory.</p>
<p>$ant junitreport</p>
<p>----> Will run the <a target="_blank" href="html/index.html">JUNIT</a> test cases and output the reports in the ./reports directory</p>
</a>

<a name="RUNNING"></a> 
<h1>RUNNING THE BIDDING SYSTEM</h1>
<p>In order to run the bidder, you will need a sample campaign. The campaigns are stored in a JSON file that the bidder loads when it starts. There is a sample campaign called "./Campaigns/payday.json' you can use to get started. The campaign describes
the various constraints you are looking for (such as price, size, etc), the form of the tracking pixel, and the returned HTML
to the exchange (the 'bid'). There is a README.md file in the ./Campaigns directory that explains the format of the campaign, and how to build your constraints.</p>
<p>The ant target 'xrtb' will run the server  with payload.json as its configuration.</p>
<p>$ant xrtb</p>

</hr>

<a name="SIMULATOR"></a> 
<h1>RUNNING THE SIMULATOR</h1>
<p>The simulator provides you with the ability to send test bids to your campaigns loaded in the bidder. You fill out an HTML
page for what the bid should look like, press Test button and the bid request is sent. The bidders response JSON is
returned plus a visual display of your tracking pixel.</p>
<p>The simulator reads a sample campaign construct in the ./web directory called "./web/config.json" file. This file sets up those parameters you can change through the web page. This file looks exactly like the ../Campaigns file. So look in the
README.md in ./Campaigns directory for more information.</p>
<br/>
<b>WARNING: DO NOT MODIFY ./Campaigns/payday.json ALL OF THE TEST CASES DEPEND ON THIS FILE</b>

<hr/>

<a name="THEORY"></a> 
<h1>THEORY OF OPERATION</h1>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>All configuration items are placed in a file (in the example above, ./Campaigns/payday.json is used).
The top level field "instance" defines the name of the bidder, and will be used in all logging methods. Note,
XRTB writes its logs to REDIS, default channel "logs", which you can change with in the "app" object. If you
want to see the sample campaign, click here: <a id="displayText" href="javascript:toggle('toggleText');">./Campaigns/payday.json</a></p>


<script type="text/javascript">

function toggle(elementId) {
	var ele = document.getElementById(elementId);
	if(ele.style.display == "block") {
    		ele.style.display = "none";
  	}
	else {
		ele.style.display = "block";
	}
}

</span>



<p>The "port" field defines the TCP port the XRTB server will utilize to handle bid requests.</p>

<p>The "seats" object is a list of seat-ids used for each of the exchanges you are bidding on. The seat-id is assigned
by the exchange - it's how they know whom is bidding.</p>

<p>The "app" object defines all the operational parameters used by XRTB.</p>

<p>The app.redis object defines the REDIS host to use and where to write bids, requests, logs and wins. ONLY the wins channel must be defined - and it must be defined! The others will write to the bids, requests and logs if the channel
has been defined.</p>

<p>The app.ttl defines the throttle percentage. Set to 100 and all bid requests will be considered. Set to 50 and 50% 
of the bid requests will be rejected out of hand.</p>

<p>The app.pixel-tracking-url field defines the URL that will be called when the ad is served up.</p>

<p>The app.winurl defines where the exchange is to send win notifications. It is customary to split win and bid processing across 2 domains, that share the same REDIS cache. When a bid is made, a copy is stored in REDIS, set to expire after
some period of time. When the win notification comes in the bid needs to be retrieved to complete the transaction 
with the exchange. In systems with multiple bidders, there is no way to know which XRTB will receive the win thus
you cannot store the bid information in local memory.</p>

<p>The app.redirect-url field defines the URL when the user clicks your advertisement.</p>

<p>The app.verbosity object defines the logging level for the XRTB program. Setting app.verbosity.level to 0 means only
the most critical messages are logged to REDIS log channel. Set the level ever higher to obtain more log information.</p>

<p>The app.verbosity.nobid-reason field is for debugging. Operational use set to false. If set to true, XRTB will print on STDOUT why the bidder chose to nobid. This is the only log message sent to STDOUT.</p>

<p>The "campaigns" object is an array of objects, each one representing a campaign. If you plan to bid, you must have at
least 1 campaign defined. If you have multiple campaigns, and a bid request matches 2 or more campaigns, the campaign
chosen to bid is chosen at random.</p>

<p>The "campaign.adm-template" field defines what the bid response ADM field will look like. This is how you define those
fields you want to send to the exchange on the bid.</p>

<p>The ADM field is examined by the XRTB bidder to fill in fields you want sent to the exchange. This is done using
macro substitution fields. The XRTB fields you can substitute are:
<br/>
<pre>
		{campaign_forward_url}  Substitured from the campaig creatives forward url
		{bid_id}                Substituted from the bid's object id field.
		{ad_id}                 Substituted from the campaign id.
		{campaign_ad_price}     Substituted from the campaign's price.
		{campaign_ad_width}     Substituted from campaign creatives width
		{campaign_ad_height}    Substituted from campaign creatives height
		{creative_id}           Substituted from campaign's creative's id.
		{pub}                   Substituted from the bid request exchange.
</pre>
</p>
<p>	Note, the RTB exchange will reflect the ADM back on the win notification, and you can ask for the RTB exchange
to also substitute fields as well. See the RTB 2.1 specification for supported macro names. These are the macros
substituted by the Exchange, not the bidder. so these will return via the RTB win notification.
<br/>
<pre>

		{AUCTION_ID}        ID of the bid request; from “id” attribute.
		{AUCTION_BID_ID}    ID of the bid; from “bidid” attribute.
		{AUCTION_IMP_ID}    ID of the impression just won; from “impid” attribute.
		{AUCTION_SEAT_ID}   ID of the bidder’s seat for whom the bid was made.
		{AUCTION_AD_ID}     ID of the ad markup the bidder wishes to serve; from “adid” attribute.
		{AUCTION_PRICE}     Settlement price using the same currency and units as the bid.
		{AUCTION_CURRENCY}  The currency used in the bid (explicit or implied); for confirmation only.
</pre>
</p>
<p>The campaign-adm-template.default field sets forth the ADM field when bidding on an exchange that you have not further
defined an ADM field for. If each exchange ADM field will look the same, then just use this field.</p>

<p>The campaign-adm-template.exchanges is an array of objects that define specific ADM patterns for specific exchanges
An example would be "campaign-adm-template.exchanges[0] = {"nexage":"nexage template here"}</p>

<p>The campaign-creatives object is an array of creatives for use with the campaign. Multiple creatives allow you to
support multiple sized ads.</p>

<p>The campaign-creatives.x field sets the width of the ad in pixels.</p>

<p>The campaign-creatives.y field sets the height of the ad in pixels.</p>

<p>The campaign-creatives.impid is a field you can use to assign a different accounting id for the creative.</p>

<p>The campaign-creatives.imageurl defines the location of the ad image itself. It must be encoded, and it too supports
the macro substitutions defined above.</p>

<p>The campaign-createive.forward-url field defines the campaign id , substituted with {ad_id}.</p>

<p>The campaign-adId is the advertisement ID.</p>

<p>The campaign-price is the price to use for the bid.</p>

<p>The campaign attributes object is an array of constraints that the bid request will tested with for equality, membership etc.</p<=>

<p>Upon loading the configuration file into the Configuration class, the campaigns are created, using a set of Node objects that describe the
JSON name to look for in the RTB bid, and the acceptable values for that constraint.</p>

<h2>Receive Bid</h2>
<p>When the RTBBidder starts, it creates a an HTTP handler based on Jetty that handles all the HTTP requests coming into the bidder.
The handler will process mundane gets/posts to retrieve resources like images and javascript files placed in the ./web directory.
In addition, the bidder will produce a BidRequest object from the JSON payload of the HTTP post. The URI will determine the kind of
exchange, e.g. Nexage.</p>
<p>Note, each bid request is on a thread started by JETTY, For each one of these threads, N number of threads will be created for N campaigns. The
number of total threads is limited by a configuration parameter "maxConnections". When max connections is reached, the bid request will result in a no-bid.</p>

<h2>Campaign Select</h2>
<p>Once the Handler determines the bid request and instantiates it, the BidRequest object will then determine which, if any of the campaigns are to
be selected. If no campaign was selected, the Handler will return an HTTP 204 code to indicate no reply. Each of the campaigns is loaded into a future task to hold it, and then the tasks are started. When the tasks join, 0 or more of the campaigns may match the bid request. In this case, the campaign is chosen among the set at random.</p>

<p>Note, the RTBServer will place an X-REASON header in the HTTP that explains why the bidder did not bid on the request.</p>

<p>Also note, the RTBServer always places an X-TIME header in the HTPP that describes the time the bidder spent
processing a bid request (in milliseconds).</p>

<h2>Create Bid Response</h2>
<p>The BidRequest then produces a BidResponse that is usable for this bid request. The bid is first recorded in REDIS as a map, then the JSON form is serialized and then returned to the Handler. The bid will then be written to the HTTP response. Note, it is possible to also record the bid requests and the bids in respective REDIS publish channels. This way these messages can be analyzed for further review.</p>

<h2>Win the Auction</h2>
<p>If the exchange accepts the bid, a win notification is sent to the bidder. The handler will take that notification, which is an encoded URI of
information such as auction price, lat, lon, campaign attributes etc. and writes this information to the REDIS channel so that the win can be recorded by some downstream service. The ADM field of the original bid is returned to the exchange with the banner ad, the referer url and the pixel url.</p>

<h2>Mobile Ad Served</h2>
<p>When the mobile user's screen receives the ad, the pixel URL is fired, and URI encoded GET is read by the Handler to associate the loading of the page in the web browser with the winning bid and this information is sent to a REDIS channel, so that it can be reconciled by some downstream service with the originating bid.</p>

<h2>User Clicks the Ad</h2>
<p>When the mobile user clicks on the ad, the referrer URL is fired and this is also handled by the handler. The handler then uses the URI encoding to transmit the user's 'click' information to a REDIS channel, for further processing and accounting downstream.</p>

<h1>USING THE SIMULATOR</h1>
<p>After starting the RTB server you can send it a test bid by pointing your browser to http://localhost:8080/xrtb/simulator/exchange</p>

<p>(The test page presumes you are using the Campaigns/payday.json campaign definition file)</p>

</p>The little test page will let you change the advertiser domaon and the geo.country field in a canned bid. (you can modify the page
./web/exchange.html if you want to add more constraints)</p>

<p>If you want to modify other  parts of the canned bid then use the JavaScript window to set the values. For example, you can override
the id by using bid.id = '11111'; in the window. Push the Free Form "Show" button and the canned bid is shown as a JavaScript object. Make
the changes you want in that object and then...</p>

<p>Press the Test button - The X-TIME of the bid/response will be shown. The NURL will be returned and the image of the advertisement is displayed. Below this you can see the contents
of the bid/response. If the server bid, you can send a win notification by pressing the "Send Win" button. The image will then be returned to the browser. Clicking the ad sends you to a dummy ad page.</p>

<p>----> To see a no bid, select GER for geo.country. The X-REASON will then be displayed on the page.</p>

<hr/>

<a name="REDIS"></a> 
<h1>REDIS COMMANDS</h1>
<p>The RTB Bidding engine uses REDIS pub/sub for all communications. The bidding engines transmit copies of bid requests, bids, win notifications and clicks through separate channels, all defined in the configuration file under the app.redis object.</p>

<p>You can also use REDIS to send the bidder(s) commands to add campaigns, delete campaigns, start the bidder, stop the bidder and retrieve statistics. Each command is a JSON string. Look in the package com.xrtb.commands for examples on the actual command formats. However,
here are the basics. The bidders listen on the 'commands' topic, and return values on 'responses' topic.</p>

<p>At a minimum, each command has the following required fields:</p>

<pre>
cmd    - 0 = add campaign, 1 = delete cam[aign ,2 = start bidder , 3 = stop bidder, 4 = set percentage og bids, 5 = echo status
uuid   - a unique identifier the sender adds this to the command so that responses can be matched to command.
</pre>

<p>Other fields are optional:</p>
<pre>
to     - the name of the entity to transmit back to.
from   - the name of the bidder responding.
msg    - a text message, if applicable.
status - Indicates 'ok' or an error message.
</pre>
<p>Each of the commands and their responses may have additional fields. Here are examples</p>

<h2>Echo</h2>
<p>Send: {cmd:5,id:"12345"}</p>
<p>returns:</p>
<pre>
{
    "cmd": 5,
    "from": "this-systems-instance-name-here",
