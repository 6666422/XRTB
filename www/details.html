<h1>RTB4FREE Bidder</h1>
<i>(NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS)</i><br>
<p>A Real Time Broker (RTB) 2.2 bidding engine written in Java 1.8</p>

The RTB4FREE project contains 3 major components: 
<ul>
	<li>Real Time Bidding engine</li>
	<li>Simulator for sending test bids</li>
	<li>Administration system for campaign definition</li>
</ul>
<p>
This project is for those fairly familiar with RTB. With a basic understanding of RTB, this project will get you
up and running with a commercial grade bidder in a short period of time.
</p>
A production bidding enterprise would most likely require multiple bidding engines running behind a firewall. This project
does not provide NGINX or AWS Load Balancer (or similar) infrastructure for this, you will need to tailor the 
administration of the XRTB to deal with these production issues. The XRTB comes out of the box ready to run in
a multi-server bidding farm, you just need to lash it up and administer it.</p>

<h1>BUILDING THE SYSTEM</h1>
<p>You will need ANT, JAVA 1.8, and REDIS installed to build the system. The dependent libraries required are already placed in the ./libs directory</p>
If you use Eclipse or some other IDE, make your project includes the ./libs directory.</p>
<p>Note, there is a .gitignore file included.
<p>
Now use ant to build the system:
</p>
$ant
<p>----> Will create ./libs/xrtb.jar    -- Which is the jar file of the project.</p>
<p>$ant javadoc</p>
<p>----> Will create <a target="_blank" href="javadoc/index.html">javadoc</a> documents in the ./javadoc directory.</p>
<p>$ant junitreport</p>
<p>----> Will run the <a target="_blank" href="html/index.html">JUNIT</a> test cases and output the reports in the ./reports directory</p>
</a>

<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a> 
<h1>Running the Bidding System</h1>
<p>In order to run the bidding system you first have to load an initial database into Redis, then construct a configuration file for use
on startup, and then you can actually start the bidding engine. The steps below will accomplish these tasks</p>
<h2>Creating Initial Database as JSON File</h2>
<p>Before you can use the bidding system, the RTB4FREE bidders have to be configured. The dirst thing to configure is the User database, which is
actually a JAVA ConcurrentHashMap, that is shared across all the bidders (regardless of what host they are on) as a Redisson object. Redisson
provides the shared context among all the bidders. Redisson uses the REDIS key/value store. By using Redisson, RTN4FREE can share the User/Campaign
database simply by instantiating the Map and using it as normal. Bidder A makes a change, Bidder B can immediately see the changes</p>
<p>There are multiple records of the User object in the Map. The User object is  simple object with the name, a time stamp, and a List of Campaign
records. The initial Redisson database is loaded from file using the DbTools program. A sample first database is provided as ./database.json
Simply run the DBTools program and this initial database will be stored in Redis for you. From there you can easilyrun the rest of the system. 
The database.hson file has one user "ben", and "ben" has 2 campaigns. The contents
of ./database.json can be viewed 
  <a id="display1" href="javascript:toggle('databaseJSON');"> here.</a></p></a>
   <div onclick="javascript:toggle('databaseJSON');">
			<div id="databaseJSON" style="display:none;">
            <iframe src="database.json" seamless width="800" height="800" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>
</p>
<h2>Load Initial Database File into Redis(son)</h2>
<p>Witht the initial database.json, we will now load the database.json into Redisson. Simoly run the following ant command:
<pre>
	$ant load-database
</pre>
This will load database.json from the current directory into the Redis system running on localhost. To change the
parameters of DbTools, look at the JAVADOC for <a href="javadoc/tools/DbTools.html" target="_blank"><i>tools.DbTools.java</i></a> for details
on how to use the DbTools program.</p>
<p>The database in Redis is  where all the User/Campaign records are stored, but, then
to run these campaigns, you must tell the bidders to pull these campaigns into their local memory (using a Redis command).
The database in Redis is the static location for the Users and their Campaigns. To 'run' a campaign' you load it into the
bidders local memory. All the bidders have a ConcurrentHashMap that comprises this database, and it is shared across
all the bidders.</p>
<p>In a commercial setting, you would likely replace this Database part of RTB4FREE with your own database management system.</p>
<h2>Configuring the Bidder</h2>
<p>After loading the database in Redis, you need to configure the bidder, start it, and load at least one campaign into the system</p>
<p>In order to run the bidder, you will need to load a campaign into the bidders memory and setup some operational parameters. These
parameters are stored in a JSON file the bidder uses when it starts. There is a sample initialization file called "./Campaigns/payday.json' 
you can use to get started. The file describes the operational parameters of the bidder. There is a README.md file in the ./Campaigns directory 
that explains the format of the campaign, and how to build your constraints.If you want to see the sample configuration, click here: <a id="displayText" href="javascript:toggle('toggleText');">./Campaigns/payday.json</a></p>

The top level field "instance" defines the name of the bidder, and will be used in all logging methods. Note,
RTB4FREE writes its logs to REDIS, default channel "logs", which you can change with in the "app" object. 
<p>The "port" field defines the TCP port the XRTB server will utilize to handle bid requests.</p>
<p>The "geotags" object defines the location of two files used by RTB4FREE to determine state, county, and 
zipcode information from GPS coordinates found in the bid request</p>
<p>The "seats" object is a list of seat-ids used for each of the exchanges you are bidding on. The seat-id is assigned
by the exchange - it's how they know whom is bidding.</p>
<p>The "app" object defines all the operational parameters used by XRTB.</p>
<p>The app.redis object defines the REDIS host to use and where to write bids, requests, logs and wins. ONLY the wins channel must be defined - and it must be defined! The others will write to the bids, requests and logs if the channel
has been defined.</p>
<p>The app.ttl defines the throttle percentage. Set to 100 and all bid requests will be considered. Set to 50 and 50% 
of the bid requests will be rejected out of hand.</p>
<p>The app.pixel-tracking-url field defines the URL that will be called when the ad is served up.</p>
<p>The app.winurl defines where the exchange is to send win notifications. It is customary to split win and bid processing across 2 domains, that share the same REDIS cache. When a bid is made, a copy is stored in REDIS, set to expire after
some period of time. When the win notification comes in the bid needs to be retrieved to complete the transaction 
with the exchange. In systems with multiple bidders, there is no way to know which XRTB will receive the win thus
you cannot store the bid information in local memory.</p>
<p>The app.redirect-url field defines the URL when the user clicks your advertisement.</p>
<p>The app.verbosity object defines the logging level for the XRTB program. Setting app.verbosity.level to 0 means only
the most critical messages are logged to REDIS log channel. Set the level ever higher to obtain more log information.</p>
<p>The app.verbosity.nobid-reason field is for debugging. Operational use set to false. If set to true, XRTB will print on STDOUT why the bidder chose to nobid. This is the only log message sent to STDOUT.</p>

<p>The "campaigns" object is an array of campaign names (by adId) that will be initially loaded from Redis
backed database and into the bidder's local memory. In the Campaigns/payday.json file, there is one campaign pre-loaded for you
called "ben:payday"  If you plan to bid, you must have at least 1 campaign loaded into the bidder. If you have 
multiple campaigns, and a bid request matches 2 or more campaigns, the campaign to bid is chosen at random.</p>

</div>
Remember these campaigns are stored in the Redis database as an element of a User, and must be subsequently loaded into the bidder in order 
for bidding to take place</p>
<p>The "campaign.adm-template" field defines what the bid response ADM field will look like.</p>
<p>The ADM field is examined by the XRTB bidder to fill in fields you want sent to the exchange. This is done using
macro substitution fields. The XRTB fields you can substitute are:
<br/>
<pre>
		{campaign_forward_url}  Substitured from the campaig creatives forward url
		{bid_id}                Substituted from the bid's object id field.
		{ad_id}                 Substituted from the campaign id.
		{campaign_ad_price}     Substituted from the campaign's price.
		{campaign_ad_width}     Substituted from campaign creatives width
		{campaign_ad_height}    Substituted from campaign creatives height
		{creative_id}           Substituted from campaign's creative's id.
		{pub}                   Substituted from the bid request exchange.
</pre>
</p>
<p>	Note, the RTB exchange will reflect the ADM back on the win notification, and you can ask for the RTB exchange
to also substitute fields as well. See the RTB 2.1 specification for supported macro names. These are the macros
substituted by the Exchange, not the bidder. so these will return via the RTB win notification.
<br/>
<pre>

		{AUCTION_ID}        ID of the bid request; from “id” attribute.
		{AUCTION_BID_ID}    ID of the bid; from “bidid” attribute.
		{AUCTION_IMP_ID}    ID of the impression just won; from “impid” attribute.
		{AUCTION_SEAT_ID}   ID of the bidder’s seat for whom the bid was made.
		{AUCTION_AD_ID}     ID of the ad markup the bidder wishes to serve; from “adid” attribute.
		{AUCTION_PRICE}     Settlement price using the same currency and units as the bid.
		{AUCTION_CURRENCY}  The currency used in the bid (explicit or implied); for confirmation only.
</pre>
</p>
<p>The campaign-adm-template.default field sets forth the ADM field when bidding on an exchange that you have not further
defined an ADM field for. If each exchange ADM field will look the same, then just use this field.</p>

<p>The campaign-adm-template.exchanges is an array of objects that define specific ADM patterns for specific exchanges
An example would be "campaign-adm-template.exchanges[0] = {"nexage":"nexage template here"}</p>

<p>The campaign-creatives object is an array of creatives for use with the campaign. Multiple creatives allow you to
support multiple sized ads.</p>

<p>The campaign-creatives.x field sets the width of the ad in pixels.</p>

<p>The campaign-creatives.y field sets the height of the ad in pixels.</p>

<p>The campaign-creatives.impid is a field you can use to assign a different accounting id for the creative.</p>

<p>The campaign-creatives.imageurl defines the location of the ad image itself. It must be encoded, and it too supports
the macro substitutions defined above.</p>

<p>The campaign-createive.forward-url field defines the campaign id , substituted with {ad_id}.</p>

<p>The campaign-adId is the advertisement ID.</p>

<p>The campaign-price is the price to use for the bid.</p>

<p>The campaign attributes object is an array of constraints that the bid request will tested with for equality, membership etc.</p<=>

<h2>Running the Bidder</h2>
<p>Now that the intitial configuration files are setup, now you start the bidder. From ant it's real simple, there is a target that uses 
Campaigns/payday.json as the configuration file:
<pre>
	$ant xrtb
</pre>
This will run RTB4FREE in the foreground. To run in the background use:
<pre>
	$nohup anf xrtb > /dev/null &
</pre>
<a name="SIMULATOR"></a> 
<h1>RUNNING THE SIMULATOR</h1>
<p>The simulator provides you with the ability to send test bids to your campaigns loaded in the bidder. You fill out an HTML
page for what the bid should look like, press Test button and the bid request is sent. The bidders response JSON is
returned plus a visual display of your tracking pixel.</p>
<p>The simulator reads a sample campaign construct in the ./web directory called "./web/config.json" file. This file sets up those parameters you can change through the web page. This file looks exactly like the ../Campaigns file. So look in the
README.md in ./Campaigns directory for more information.</p>

<a name="THEORY"></a> 
<h1>THEORY OF OPERATION</h1>
<h2>Use of Redis</h2>
Redis is used as the shared context between all bidders. All shared data is kept in Redis, and all bidders connect
to this Redis instance to share data. Specifically, the response to a bid request, a 'bid', is stored in Redis after
it is made, because on the win notification, a completely separate bidder may process the win, and the original bid
must be retrieved as quickly as possible to complete the transaction. A database query is far to slow fo this. This is
the main use for Redis</p>
<p>Another use for Redis is its publish/subscribe system. Commands are sent to running bidders over a Redis channel. 
Likewise responses to commands are sent back on another Redis channel. Clockthrough notification is sent on yet another
channel.</p>
<h2>Redission Based Shared Database</h2>
<p>A database of Users and their campaigns is kept in a ConcurrentHashMap, that is created from a Redisson object. This
allows the bidders to maintain a shared database. The HashMap is actually backed in Redis using the Redisson system.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>A configuration fike is used to set up the basic operating parameters of the bidder (such as Redis channels) and to 
load any initial campaigns from the Database in Redis.</p?
<p>Upon loading the configuration file into the Configuration class, the campaigns are created, using a set of Node objects that describe the
JSON name to look for in the RTB bid, and the acceptable values for that constraint.</p>

<h2>Receive Bid</h2>
<p>When the RTBBidder starts, it creates a an HTTP handler based on Jetty that handles all the HTTP requests coming into the bidder.
The handler will process mundane gets/posts to retrieve resources like images and javascript files placed in the ./web directory.
In addition, the bidder will produce a BidRequest object from the JSON payload of the HTTP post. The URI will determine the kind of
exchange, e.g. Nexage.</p>
<p>Note, each bid request is on a thread started by JETTY, For each one of these threads, N number of threads will be created for N campaigns. The
number of total threads is limited by a configuration parameter "maxConnections". When max connections is reached, the bid request will result in a no-bid.</p>

<h2>Campaign Select</h2>
<p>Once the Handler determines the bid request and instantiates it, the BidRequest object will then determine which, if any of the campaigns are to
be selected. If no campaign was selected, the Handler will return an HTTP 204 code to indicate no reply. Each of the campaigns is loaded into a future task to hold it, and then the tasks are started. When the tasks join, 0 or more of the campaigns may match the bid request. In this case, the campaign is chosen among the set at random.</p>

<p>Note, the RTBServer will place an X-REASON header in the HTTP that explains why the bidder did not bid on the request.</p>

<p>Also note, the RTBServer always places an X-TIME header in the HTPP that describes the time the bidder spent
processing a bid request (in milliseconds).</p>

<h2>Create Bid Response</h2>
<p>The BidRequest then produces a BidResponse that is usable for this bid request. The bid is first recorded in REDIS as a map, then the JSON form is serialized and then returned to the Handler. The bid will then be written to the HTTP response. Note, it is possible to also record the bid requests and the bids in respective REDIS publish channels. This way these messages can be analyzed for further review.</p>

<h2>Win the Auction</h2>
<p>If the exchange accepts the bid, a win notification is sent to the bidder. The handler will take that notification, which is an encoded URI of
information such as auction price, lat, lon, campaign attributes etc. and writes this information to the REDIS channel so that the win can be recorded by some downstream service. The ADM field of the original bid is returned to the exchange with the banner ad, the referer url and the pixel url.</p>

<h2>Mobile Ad Served</h2>
<p>When the mobile user's screen receives the ad, the pixel URL is fired, and URI encoded GET is read by the Handler to associate the loading of the page in the web browser with the winning bid and this information is sent to a REDIS channel, so that it can be reconciled by some downstream service with the originating bid.</p>

<h2>User Clicks the Ad</h2>
<p>When the mobile user clicks on the ad, the referrer URL is fired and this is also handled by the handler. The handler then uses the URI encoding to transmit the user's 'click' information to a REDIS channel, for further processing and accounting downstream.</p>

<h1>USING THE SIMULATOR</h1>
<p>After starting the RTB server you can send it a test bid by pointing your browser to http://localhost:8080/xrtb/simulator/exchange</p>

<p>(The test page presumes you are using the Campaigns/payday.json campaign definition file)</p>

</p>The little test page will let you change the advertiser domaon and the geo.country field in a canned bid. (you can modify the page
./web/exchange.html if you want to add more constraints)</p>

<p>If you want to modify other  parts of the canned bid then use the JavaScript window to set the values. For example, you can override
the id by using bid.id = '11111'; in the window. Push the Free Form "Show" button and the canned bid is shown as a JavaScript object. Make
the changes you want in that object and then...</p>

<p>Press the Test button - The X-TIME of the bid/response will be shown. The NURL will be returned and the image of the advertisement is displayed. Below this you can see the contents
of the bid/response. If the server bid, you can send a win notification by pressing the "Send Win" button. The image will then be returned to the browser. Clicking the ad sends you to a dummy ad page.</p>

<p>----> To see a no bid, select GER for geo.country. The X-REASON will then be displayed on the page.</p>

<a name="REDIS"></a> 
<h1>REDIS COMMANDS</h1>
<p>The RTB Bidding engine uses REDIS pub/sub for all communications. The basic commands are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="#ECHO">Echo, return status.</a></li>
	<li><a href="#LOAD">Load Campaign into Redis Database.</a></li>
	<li><a href="#DELETE">Delete Campaign from Redis Database.</a></li>	
	<li><a href="#START">Start A Campaign (load from Redis into Bidders Memory.</a></li>
	<li><a href="#STOP">Stop a Campaign (unload campaign from Bidders memory.</a></li>
	<li><a href="#STOPBIDDER">Causes a bidder to pause, it will no-bid all bid requests.</a></li>
	<li><a href="#STARTBIDDER">Restarts a stopped bidder.</a></li>

</ul>
The commands are Java objects, all sderived from the com.xrtb.commands.BasicCommand class. (See here for the JAVADOC). 
The objectsare serialized and then sent to the Redis <i>commands</i> topic. The responses to the commands are transmitted 
back via the <i>responses</i>topic.</p>
<p>In order to make communications with the bidding system easier, a program called <i>tools.Commander</i> is provided so that you can
easily send and receive commands with the bidding engines. In the following sub-sections each of these commands is discussed and
the appropriate Commander use is shown. To start the Commander, use ant:
<pre>
	$ant Commander
</pre>
(Note, this presumes you are using Redis on localhost. If you are using a different configuration, see the JAVADOC for the Commander.)
The Commander will reply with a prompt, then you specify the appropriate response on STDIN
<pre>
	$ant Commander
	RTB4FREE Commander
	Command: (1=Echo, 2=Load, 3=Delete, 4=Stop Campaign, 5=Start Campaign, 6=Start Bidder, 7=Stop Bidder
	?? 
</pre>
	
<a name="ECHO"></a>
<h2>Echo</h2>
The echo command will prompt the bidders to reply with their status. The status will include a list of the campaigns it is running as
well as summary statistics about the use of the system. Example use:
<pre>
	$ant Commander
	RTB4FREE Commander
	Command: (1=Echo, 2=Load, 3=Delete, 4=Stop Campaign, 5=Start Campaign, 6=Start Bidder, 7=Stop Bidder
	?? 1
	Echo to?
</pre>
The command has 1 argument, 'to'. Put the instance name of which bidder you want to respond, otherwise, simply
pressing cr will cause all bidders to respond. The bidding engines transmit copies of bid requests, bids, win 
notifications and clicks through separate channels, all defined in the configuration file under the app.redis object.</p>
<p>You can also use REDIS to send the bidder(s) commands to add campaigns, delete campaigns, start the bidder, stop the bidder and retrieve statistics. Each command is a JSON string. Look in the package com.xrtb.commands for examples on the actual command formats. However,
here are the basics. The bidders listen on the 'commands' topic, and return values on 'responses' topic. Each of the 
commands and their responses may have additional fields. Here are examples</p>

<p>The echo command retrieves status information about a bidder's state. All of its campaigns are listed, as well
as some summary statistics. The class implementing this is <i>com.xrtb.commands.Echo.java</i>. An example echo response
from the Commander program can be seen below:</p>

<pre>
RTB4FREE Commander (1=Echo, 2=Load into DB, 3=Delete from DB, 4=Stop Campaign, 5=Start Campaign, 6=Start Bidder, 7=Stop Bidder, 8=Exit)
