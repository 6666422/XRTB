                PROGRESS)</i><br>

                <p>A Real Time Bidder (RTB 2.2) engine written in Java
                1.8</p>The RTB4FREE project contains 3 major components:

                <ul>
                    <li>Real Time Bidding engine</li>

                    <li>Simulator for sending test bids</li>

                    <li>Administration system for campaign definition</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This project is for those fairly familiar with RTB. With a
                basic understanding of RTB, this project will get you up and
                running with a commercial grade bidder in a short period of
                time.</p>A production bidding enterprise would most likely
                require multiple bidding engines running behind a firewall.
                This project does not provide NGINX or AWS Load Balancer (or
                similar) infrastructure for this, you will need to tailor the
                administration of the XRTB to deal with these production
                issues. The XRTB comes out of the box ready to run in a
                multi-server bidding farm, you just need to lash it up and
                administer it.

                <h1>QUICK START</h1>

                <p>The following brings the XRTB system up and running on your local machine in 5 minutes, presuming you have 
                Git REDIS, Ant, and Java 1.8 installed on your local machine and REDIS is already running.</p>
                
                <p>In one window:</p>
                <pre>
$git clone https://github.com/benmfaul/XRTB.git
cd XRTB
$ant

</pre>
<p>Now you have it all built. But, the RTB4FREE system comes out of the box using localhost:8080 for all it's operations. 
Obviously, for a real RTB system that's not going to work. Your RTB4FREE bidder has to be open on the Internet for the
exchanges to contact. So, you setup RTB4FREE's web access to use your address. If your host's IP address is 199,188.62.6
you need to modify all the web based files to use this. This is easy, edit build.xml and look for the "config-website"
target. Modify the "-address RTB4FREE.com" line with "-address 192.188.62.6". <b>REMOVE THE "-www /usr/share/nginx/" PARAMETER.</b>
Now configure the website, load the database, and start RTB4FREE.
<pre>
$ant config-website
$ant load-database
$ant xrtb
</pre>

You should see the RTB4FREE bidder come up, and print some logging information. In another console window type the following</p>
<pre>
$cd XRTB
$sh curltest.sh
</pre>

You should see the JSON returned for the bid request. Also, in the console window of the RTB4FREE bidder you will see 
various messages as the bid request from the curl test is processed.</p>

<p>Defining actual ad markup requires an understanding of the structure of how campaigns are defined and loaded into REDIS, and how startup file
is formatted. <a href="admarkup.html" target="_blank">For a tutorial on how ad markup is described, look here. </a>

                <h1>SECURE REDIS</h1>
				<p>When you installed REDIS, likely you did not set a password. This is a mistake. Sooner or
				later a troll is going to enter your system and mess with your REDIS installation. Do yourself a favor and set
				the REDIS system to use authentication. Look here for the <a href="http://redis.io/topics/quickstart">quick installation guide for REDIS</a></p>
				<p>Once you have a password set up, then you can tell RTB4FREE the password by making a hidden file named '.passwords'
				in the same directory where you start the RTB4FREE server. The file just contains one line, the password to your REDIS
				system. It might also be a good idea to chmod 400 .passwords as weel to keep other users from accessing this file.</p>

                <a id="WEBDIS" name="CONFIG WEBDIS""></a>

                <h1>SET UP WEBDIS</h1>
				<p>Webdis is a very simple web server providing an HTTP interface to Redis. It is used by RTB4FREE to transmit log
				information to the System Console web page. RTB4FREE will run without Webdis installed, but you won't be able to
				see the logging information from the System Console.</p>
				<p><a href="http://webd.is/" target="_blank">Look here for instructions on how to install and configure Webdis.</a></p>
				<p>Note, if you set up a password for Redis, make sure you let Webdis know about it. In the Webdis directory is a JSON file called
				webdis.json. Look for the line:
				<pre>
	"redis_auth": null,
				</pre>
				And change it to your REDIS password:
				<pre>
	"redis_auth": "mysuperdooperpassword",
				</pre>
           
             
                
                <hr/>
                <a id="BUILD" name="BUILD"></a>

                <h1>BUILDING THE SYSTEM</h1>

                <p>You will need ANT, JAVA 1.8, and REDIS installed to build
                the system. The dependent libraries required are already placed
                in the ./libs directory</p>If you use Eclipse or some other
                IDE, make your project includes the ./libs directory.
                <p>

                <p>Note, there is a stub .gitignore file included, (named gitignore, rename it to .gitignore).</p>

                <p>Now use ant to build the system:</p>$ant

                <p>----&gt; Will create ./libs/xrtb.jar -- Which is the jar
                file of the project.</p>

                <p>$ant javadoc</p>

                <p>----&gt; Will create <a href="javadoc/index.html" target=
                "_blank">javadoc</a> documents in the ./javadoc directory.</p>

                <p>$ant junitreport</p>

                <p>----&gt; Will run the <a href="html/index.html" target=
                "_blank">JUNIT</a> test cases and output the reports in the
                ./reports directory</p><a id="CONFIGURATION" name=
                "CONFIGURATION"></a>

                <h1>Running the Bidding System</h1>

                <p>In order to run the bidding system you first have to load an
                initial database into Redis, then construct a configuration
                file for use on startup, and then you can actually start the
                bidding engine. The steps below will accomplish these tasks</p>

                <h2>Creating Initial Database as JSON File</h2>

                <p>Before you can use the bidding system, the RTB4FREE bidders
                have to be configured. The dirst thing to configure is the User
                database, which is actually a JAVA ConcurrentHashMap, that is
                shared across all the bidders (regardless of what host they are
                on) as a Redisson object. Redisson provides the shared context
                among all the bidders. Redisson uses the REDIS key/value store.
                By using Redisson, RTB4FREE can share the User/Campaign
                database simply by instantiating the Map and using it as
                normal. Bidder A makes a change, Bidder B can immediately see
                the changes</p>

                <p>There are multiple records of the User object in the Map.
                The User object is simple object with the name, a time stamp,
                and a List of Campaign records. The initial Redisson database
                is loaded from file using the DbTools program. A sample first
                database is provided as ./database.json Simply run the DBTools
                program and this initial database will be stored in Redis for
                you. From there you can easilyrun the rest of the system. The
                database.hson file has one user "ben", and "ben" has several
                campaigns. The contents of ./database.json can be viewed
                <a href="javascript:toggle('databaseJSON');" id=
                "display1">here.</a></p>

                <div onclick="javascript:toggle('databaseJSON');">
                    <div id="databaseJSON" style="display:none;">
                        <iframe frameborder="0" height="800" seamless="" src=
                        "database.json" width="800"></iframe>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>

                <h2>Load Initial Database File into Redis(son)</h2>

                <p>With the initial database.json, we will now load the
                database.json into Redisson. Simply run the following ant
                command:</p>
                <pre>
    $ant load-database
</pre>This will load database.json from the current directory into the Redis
system running on a host. To change the parameters of DbTools, look at the
JAVADOC for <a href="javadoc/tools/DbTools.html" style="font-style: italic"
                target="_blank">tools.DbTools.java</a> for details on how to
                use the DbTools program.
                <p>

                <p>The database in Redis is where all the User/Campaign records
                are stored, but, then to run these campaigns, you must tell the
                bidders to pull these campaigns into their local memory (using
                a Redis command). The database in Redis is the static location
                for the Users and their Campaigns. To 'run' a campaign' you
                load it into the bidders local memory. All the bidders have a
                ConcurrentHashMap that comprises this database, and it is
                shared across all the bidders.</p>

                <p>In a commercial setting, you would likely replace this
                Database part of RTB4FREE with your own database management
                system.</p>

                <h2>Configuring the Bidder</h2>

                <p>After loading the database in Redis, you need to configure
                the bidder, start it, and load at least one campaign into the
                system</p>

                <p>In order to run the bidder, you will need to load a campaign
                into the bidders memory and setup some operational parameters.
                These parameters are stored in a JSON file the bidder uses when
                it starts. There is a sample initialization file called
                "./Campaigns/payday.json' you can use to get started. The file
                describes the operational parameters of the bidder. There is a
                README.md file in the ./Campaigns directory that explains the
                format of the campaign, and how to build your constraints.If
                you want to see the sample configuration, click here: <a href=

                <p>The "seats" object is a list of seat-ids used for each of
                the exchanges you are bidding on. The seat-id is assigned by
                the exchange - it's how they know whom is bidding. The name attribute
                defines the name of the exchange, as it will appear in all the logs. The id is
                the actual id name the bidder sends to the exchange as the seat id - how the exchange
                knows who you are. The bid attribute tells the bidder where the JAVA class is
                for that exchange. In the above example, 3 exchanges are described.</p>
                
                <p>The "app" object sets up the rest of the configuration for the RTB4FREE server</p>

                <p>The "geotags" object defines the location of two files used
                by RTB4FREE to determine state, county, and zipcode information
                from GPS coordinates found in the bid request. The geotags  object is
                not required.</p>

                <p>The app.redis object defines the REDIS host the bidders will to use and where
                to write bids, requests, logs and wins. ONLY the wins channel
                must be defined - and it must be defined or you will nor receive any win notifications! 
                Otherwise, if you want to see the requests, define the channel, likewise for bids and clicks.</p>

                <p>The app.ttl defines the time to live value for bid keys in REDIS, in seconds. This
                means that after 5 minutes the key is deleted - and if the WIN notification comes in you will
                not process it - as the key is gone. You cannot let the keys pile up forever, REDIS will
                wun out of memory. This is a compromise between accuracy and performance.</p>

                <p>The app.pixel-tracking-url field defines the URL that will
                be called when the ad is served up.</p>

                <p>The app.winurl defines where the exchange is to send win
                notifications. It is customary to split win and bid processing
                across 2 domains, that share the same REDIS cache. When a bid
                is made, a copy is stored in REDIS, set to expire after some
                period of time (app.tt;). When the win notification comes in the bid
                needs to be retrieved to complete the transaction with the
                exchange. In systems with multiple bidders, there is no way to
                know which XRTB will receive the win thus you cannot store the
                bid information in local memory.</p>

                <p>The app.redirect-url field defines the URL to use when the user
                clicks your advertisement.</p>

                <p>The app.verbosity object defines the logging level for the
                XRTB program. Setting app.verbosity.level to 1 means only the
                most critical messages are logged to REDIS log channel. Set the
                level ever higher to obtain more log information. The logs are published
                to the REDIS publish topic defined by redis.logger. However, if you want
                the logger to also print on STDOUT too, set the log level to a negative value.
                For example, "level": -5 means to log all kind of stuff, and also print it
                in STDOUT.</p>

                <p>The app.verbosity.nobid-reason field is for debugging and is used
                to tell you why the bidder did not bid. This is useful if things aren't working like
                you think it should. It creates a lot of output and it doubles the amount of time it 
                takes to process a bid request.
                Operational useers should set this set to false. If set to true, the bidder log why the bidder 
                chose to nobid on each creative, for each campaign.</p>

                <p>The "campaigns" object is an array of campaign objects that specify what campaigns
                to preload. THe "name" is the Campaign owner, the "id" is the adid of the campaign to preload. In the
                Campaigns/payday.json file, for demo purposes there is one campaign pre-loaded
                for you called "ben:payday", from the campaigns owner "ben". <b>Note, the id field field accepts JAVA regular expressions. In the example
                the campaign that matches 'ben:payday' is loaded. To load all campaigns use '(.*). To load only
                campaigns prefixed with 'ben', then use 'ben(.*)'.</b> 
                <p>If you plan to bid (and win), you must have
                at least 1 campaign loaded into the bidder. If you have
                multiple campaigns, and a bid request matches 2 or more
                campaigns, the campaign to bid is chosen at random.</p>

                <p>If you want to see what a campaign looks like in JSON form,
                look <a href="javascript:toggle('toggleCamp');" id=

                <p>Remember these campaigns are stored in the Redis database
                as an element of a User, and must be subsequently loaded into
                the bidder in order for bidding to take place
                <p>
                

                <p>The "campaign.adm-template" field defines what the bid
                response ADM field will look like.</p>

                <p>The ADM field is examined by the XRTB bidder to fill in
                fields you want sent to the exchange. This is done using macro
                substitution fields. The RTB4FREE fields you can substitute
                are:<br></p>
<pre>
        {ad_id}                 Substituted from the campaign id.
        {bid_id}                Substituted from the bid's object id field.
        {creative_ad_height}    Substituted from campaign creatives height
        {creative_ad_price}     Substituted from the campaign's price.
        {creative_ad_width}     Substituted from campaign creatives width
        {creative_forward_url}  Substitured from the campaign creatives forward url
        {creative_image_url}	Substituted from the campain creative's image url
        {creative_id}           Substituted from campaign's creative's id.
        {pub}                   Substituted from the bid request exchange.
        {site_id}				Substituted from the bid request's site id.
        {site_domain}			Substituted from the bid request's site domaom
</pre>
                <p>

                <p>Note, the RTB exchange can make substitutions in the ADM field as it delivers
                it to the web site. The RTB exchange will reflect the ADM back on the win
                notification, and you can ask for the RTB exchange to also
                substitute fields as well. See the RTB 2.3 specification for
                supported macro names.</p><p>These are the macros substituted by the
                Exchange, not the bidder. so these will return via the RTB win
                notification and as the ad is delivered into the web page.<br></p>
                <pre>

        {AUCTION_ID}        ID of the bid request; from “id” attribute.
        {AUCTION_BID_ID}    ID of the bid; from “bidid” attribute.
        {AUCTION_IMP_ID}    ID of the impression just won; from “impid” attribute.
        {AUCTION_SEAT_ID}   ID of the bidder’s seat for whom the bid was made.
        {AUCTION_AD_ID}     ID of the ad markup the bidder wishes to serve; from “adid” attribute.
        {AUCTION_PRICE}     Settlement price using the same currency and units as the bid.
        {AUCTION_CURRENCY}  The currency used in the bid (explicit or implied); for confirmation only.

<p>The attributes define the specific RTB bid request constraints to be used to determine if
a campaign will consider bidding. Each attribute has a "value", an "op", a "notPresentOk", and 
a "bidRequestValues" defined.</p>
<p>The "value" sets up the values the campaign is looking for in a bid request. In the first
attribute shown above it is an array of strings: [ "chive.com", "junk.com"]. Although this
value could have been an integer, a floating point number, or an array of numbers.</p>
<p>The "op" field defines what operator the RTB4FREE bidder will use against value defined by
 the bidRequestValues. Here, the operator is NOT_MEMBER.</p>
 <p>The "bidRequestValues" defines what we are looking for in the bid request. In the example above we
 are looking for site.domain. We pull this value out of the bid request and apply the operator to the value.</p>
 <p>In this case, we have made a blacklist, so the bid request comes from junk.com or chive.com, the
 operator returns false, and this campaign will not bid on the request.</p>

               <p>The campaign-creatives object is an array of creative impressions for
                use with the campaign. Every campaign
                can have multiple creatives. Multiple creatives allow you to support
                multiple sized ads and different kinds of ads, like display, video and native content for 
                a single advertising campaign. There are three types of creatives - display, video and native content.</p>
                <p>Each creative in a campaign has its own price.<p>Each of these creative types
                are described in the following sections.</p>

<p>The impid is the impression id used in the bid. w and h are self evident. The adm field contains
wither the location of the video's VAST file OR, the actual http encoded VAST TAG. The price and
currency should also be self evident. The videoProtocol is set to 2 (VAST 2). The values of this
field can be either: 1, 2 or 3 (for VAST 1, 2 or 3). The videoDuration is in seconds. The videoMimeType
specifies what your video type actually is.</p>

<h3>The <b>native ad creatives</b></h3>
<p>RTB4FREE supports the creation of Native Content advertisements. There are 7 kinds of native ads
that RTB can currently support:>
<ol>
<li>Content Wall</li>
<li>App Wall</li>
<li>News Feed</li>
<li>Chat List</li>
<li>arousel</li>
<li>Content Stream</li>
<li>Grid adjoining the content</li>
</ol>
<p>You will need to be familiar with the specification, which we provide an overview to:
<a href="native.html" tatget="_blank">RTB Specification for Native Ads</a> to understand what some of the contents mean
you can get an overview here and there are links to the spec as well. For example purposes 2 kinds of
native content will be described, first an App Wall, and then, a Content Stream. Note, these examples
track to the openRTB Native Ad Specification referenced above.</p>

Notice there is no height (h) or width (w) specified. That's because the web page will take the assets
and construct it's own view. You have no idea or control what the final view will be - it truly will
be native to the web site it will sit on.</p>
Here, the native content ad ("type":2) has 3 parts. A title ("Install BOA" with a link that is 
invoked when clicked. It also has a social ranking score attached to it as well.

                <h2>Running the Bidder</h2>

                <p>Now that the intitial configuration files are setup, now you
                start the bidder. From ant it's real simple, there is a target
                that uses Campaigns/payday.json as the configuration file:</p>
                <pre>
    $ant xrtb
</pre>This will run RTB4FREE in the foreground. To run in the background use:
                <pre>
    $nohup ant xrtb &gt; /dev/null &
</pre>

<p> the <i>$ant xerb</i> is the equivalent of running the command line of:
<pre>

    $java -cp "libs/*.jar" com.xrtb.bidder.RTBServer -p 8080 -s demo Campaigns/payday.json
</pre>
<p>The main class is com.xrtb.bidder.RTBServer. The -p tells the bidder to listen for requests on port 8080 (the default). The -s options sets 
the 'shard' key of the bidder. The default shard is an empty string.</p>
<p>The bidder's log messages, and communications channels
                are defined with the concatenation of shard + name-of-host + port on
                the machine it is running on. If the shard key is "Customer1" and the
                hostname is "amazonM4" and it is running on port 8080, then the logging
                and REDIS communication key for this bidder would be <B>Customer1:amazonM4:8080</B>
                Note, RTB4FREE writes its logs to REDIS, default channel "logs", which you can
                change with in the "app" object.</p><p>When sending commands to bidders, the commands can be 
                sent using JAVA regular expressions.</p>
<p>If you start the bidder with no arguments, it
will use the configuration file Campaigns/payday.json, port of 8080 and no shard key.</p>
<a id="SIMULATOR" name="SIMULATOR"></a>

                <h1>RUNNING THE SIMULATOR</h1>

                <p>The Bids Tester provides you with the ability to send test
                bids to your campaigns loaded in the bidder. You fill out an
                HTML page for what the bid should look like, press Test button
                and the bid request is sent. The bidders response JSON is
                returned plus a visual display of your tracking pixel.</p>

                <p>The simulator reads a sample campaign construct in the ./web
                directory called "./web/config.json" file. This file sets up
                those parameters you can change through the web page. This file
                looks exactly like the ../Campaigns file. So look in the
                README.md in ./Campaigns directory for more
                information.</p><br>
                <b>WARNING: DO NOT MODIFY ./Campaigns/payday.json ALL OF THE
                TEST CASES DEPEND ON THIS FILE</b>
                <br/><br/>
                <p>Presuming you did not modify the configuration files and you are 
                running RTB4FREE on your localhost you can type following:

                <h1>THEORY OF OPERATION</h1>

                <h2>Use of Redis</h2>Redis is used as the shared context
                between all bidders. All shared data is kept in Redis, and all
                bidders connect to this Redis instance to share data.
                Specifically, the response to a bid request, a 'bid', is stored
                in Redis after it is made, because on the win notification, a
                completely separate bidder may process the win, and the
                original bid must be retrieved as quickly as possible to
                complete the transaction. A database query is far to slow fo
                this. This is the main use for Redis
                <p>

                <p>Another use for Redis is its publish/subscribe system.
                Commands are sent to running bidders over a Redis channel.
                Likewise responses to commands are sent back on another Redis
                channel. Clockthrough notification is sent on yet another
                channel.</p>

                <h2>Redission Based Shared Database</h2>

                <p>A database of Users and their campaigns is kept in a
                ConcurrentHashMap, that is created from a Redisson object. This
                allows the bidders to maintain a shared database. The HashMap
                is actually backed in Redis using the Redisson system.</p>

                <h2>Configuration</h2>

                <p>A configuration file is used to set up the basic operating
                parameters of the bidder (such as Redis channels) and to load
                any initial campaigns from the Database in Redis.</p>Upon
                loading the configuration file into the Configuration class,
                the campaigns are created, using a set of Node objects that
                describe the JSON name to look for in the RTB bid, and the
                acceptable values for that constraint.
                <p>

                <h2>Receive Bid</h2>

                <p>When the RTBBidder starts, it creates a an HTTP handler
                based on Jetty that handles all the HTTP requests coming into
                the bidder. The handler will process mundane gets/posts to
                retrieve resources like images and javascript files placed in
                the ./web directory. In addition, the bidder will produce a
                BidRequest object from the JSON payload of the HTTP post. The
                URI will determine the kind of exchange, e.g. Nexage.</p>

                <p>Note, each bid request is on a thread started by JETTY, For
                each one of these threads, N number of threads will be created
                for N campaigns. The number of total threads is limited by a
                configuration parameter "maxConnections". When max connections
                is reached, the bid request will result in a no-bid.</p>

                <h2>Campaign Select</h2>

                <p>Once the Handler determines the bid request and instantiates
                it, the BidRequest object will then determine which, if any of
                the campaigns are to be selected. If no campaign was selected,
                the Handler will return an HTTP 204 code to indicate no reply.
                Each of the campaigns is loaded into a future task to hold it,
                and then the tasks are started. When the tasks join, 0 or more
                of the campaigns may match the bid request. In this case, the
                campaign is chosen among the set at random.</p>

                <p>Note, the RTBServer will place an X-REASON header in the
                HTTP that explains why the bidder did not bid on the
                request.</p>

                <p>Also note, the RTBServer always places an X-TIME header in
                the HTPP that describes the time the bidder spent processing a
                bid request (in milliseconds).</p>

                <h2>Create Bid Response</h2>

                <p>The BidRequest then produces a BidResponse that is usable
                for this bid request. The bid is first recorded in REDIS as a
                map, then the JSON form is serialized and then returned to the
                Handler. The bid will then be written to the HTTP response.
                Note, it is possible to also record the bid requests and the
                bids in respective REDIS publish channels. This way these
                messages can be analyzed for further review.</p>

                <h2>Win the Auction</h2>

                <p>If the exchange accepts the bid, a win notification is sent
                to the bidder. The handler will take that notification, which
                is an encoded URI of information such as auction price, lat,
                lon, campaign attributes etc. and writes this information to
                the REDIS channel so that the win can be recorded by some
                downstream service. The ADM field of the original bid is
                returned to the exchange with the display ad, the referer url
                and the pixel url.</p>

                <h2>Mobile Ad Served</h2>

                <p>When the mobile user's screen receives the ad, the pixel URL
                is fired, and URI encoded GET is read by the Handler to
                associate the loading of the page in the web browser with the
                winning bid and this information is sent to a REDIS 'clicks'
                channel, so that it can be reconciled by some downstream
                service with the originating bid.</p>

                <h2>User Clicks the Ad</h2>

                <p>When the mobile user clicks on the ad, the referrer URL is
                fired and this is also handled by the handler. The handler then
                uses the URI encoding to transmit the information to a REDIS
                channel, usually called 'clicks', for further processing and
                accounting downstream.</p>

                <h1>SENDING BIDS TO THE RTB4FREE SERVER</h1>

                <p>After starting the RTB server you can send it a test bid by
                pointing your browser to http://localhost:8080/xrtb/simulator/exchange</p>

                <p>(The test page presumes you are using the
                Campaigns/payday.json campaign definition file)</p>
                <p>The test page will let you change the bid request attributes
                domain and the geo.country field in a canned bid. You can also
                add other constraints to customize the bid request</p>
                <p>The test page supports DISPLAY, VIDEO and NATIVE CONTENT ad bid requests.
                Choose the kind of bid you want first by pressing the appropriate
                <i>Display</i> or <i>Native</i> or <i>Video</i> button first</p>

                <p>If you like, you can use the JavaScript window to set the
                values of the bid request. For example, you can override the id
                by using bid.id = '11111'; in the window. Push the Free Form
                "Show" button and the bid is shown as a JavaScript object. Make
                the changes you want in that object and then hit the 'Test'
                button</p>

                <p>Press the Test button - The X-TIME of the bid/response will
                be shown. The NURL will be returned and the image of the
                advertisement is displayed. Below this you can see the contents
                of the bid/response. If the server bid, you can send a win
                notification by pressing the "Send Win" button.This will also
                cause the contents of the ADM to be displayed as it is seen in
                the user's web browser and what the HTML was that produced it.
                <p>For display ads, you can see the actual graphic and if you press
                the ad,  the pixel and reder handlers will be called.</p>
                <p>If the bid was a video ad, the content of the ad is shown on the left, 
                and on the right, the video tag XML is shown as sent by the bidder</p>

                <p>----&gt; To see a no bid, select GER for geo.country. The
                X-REASON will then be displayed on the page.</p>

                <h1>REDIS COMMANDS</h1>

                <p>The RTB Bidding engine uses REDIS pub/sub for all
                communications. Specifically, logs are published, wins are published, 
                the bid requests can be published and you can also publish bids.</p>
                <p>In addition, the RTB4FREE servers subscribe to a commands channel and
                you can get status information, pause and restart servers, set throttles, create. delete and update campaigns
                in the servers in real time</p>
                <p>In sending commands, you can send commands to ALL the servers, or a subset of the servers, or
                to an individual server. The concept of a shard key is used with the servers. Each server
                is addressed in REDIS with its shardkey + the hostname + port number. The servers understand
                wild card naming, so if you have 5 servers you can organize them by types. For example, servers 1-3 are
                dedicated to BigCo campaigns and servers 4-5 are dedicated to everyone else. So using a shard key of "BIGCO" and
                "NOT-BIGCO", your 5 server names might look like:
                BIGCO:host1:8080, BIGCO:host2:8080, BIGCO:host3:8080, NOT-BIGCO:host4:8080, and NOT-BIGCO:host5:8080</p>
                <p>You can send a command to all of the bidders in the commands by using the name field of "*". Just BIGCO by
                using "BIGCO*".</p>
                <strong><p>Note, the shard key for the RTB4FREE.com demonstration bidder is 'demo'. The entire instancename is "demo:rtb4free.com:8080"</p></strong>
                <p>The following will show you an overview of the commands that you can
                issue from the command line tool. Looking in the package for the commands, you can see
                how to programmatically issue these commands.</p>
                <p>The basic commands are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#ECHO">Echo, return status.</a>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="#LOAD">Load Campaign into Redis Database.</a>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="#DELETE">Delete Campaign from Redis
                        Database.</a>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="#STOP">Stop a Campaign in the Bidder (Unload from bidder).</a>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="#START">Start A Campaign in the bidder (Load the bidder from REDIS.</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#STARTBIDDER">Restarts a stopped bidder.</a>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <a href="#STOPBIDDER">Causes a bidder to pause, it will
                        no-bid all bid requests.</a>
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>The commands are Java objects, all sderived from the
                com.xrtb.commands.BasicCommand class. (See here for the
                JAVADOC). The objectsare serialized and then sent to the Redis
                <i>commands</i> topic. The responses to the commands are
                transmitted back via the <i>responses</i>topic.
                <p>

                <p>In order to make communications with the bidding system
                easier, a program called <i>tools.Commander</i> is provided so
                that you can easily send and receive commands with the bidding
                engines. In the following sub-sections each of these commands
                is discussed and the appropriate Commander use is shown. To
                start the Commander, use from the top directory:</p>
                
                <pre>
    $java -cp "libs/*" tools.Commands
    
</pre>(Note, this presumes you are using Redis on localhost. If you are using a
different configuration, see the JAVADOC for the Commander.) The Commander will
reply with a prompt, then you specify the appropriate response on STDIN.
                Also remember, that when a command asks for which bidder to send to, if you use the carriage return
                the command is sent to ALL bidders. To send to a particular bidder, use it's instance name. Also, you can use JAVA
                regular expressions for the name. An example: 'demo(.*)' will match all bidders beginning
                with the shard name 'demo'.
                
<a id="ECHO" name="ECHO"></a>

                <h2>1 - Echo</h2>The echo command will prompt the bidders to reply
                with their status. The status will include a list of the
                campaigns it is running as well as summary statistics about the
                use of the system. Example use:
                <pre>
    $java -cp "libs/*" tools.Commands
    RTB4FREE Commander
    Command: (1=Echo, 2=Load, 3=Delete, 4=Stop Campaign, 5=Start Campaign, 6=Start Bidder, 7=Stop Bidder
    ?? 1
    Echo to?
</pre>The command has 1 argument, 'to'. Put the instance name of which bidder
you want to respond, otherwise, simply pressing cr will cause all bidders to
respond. <b>You can also use JAVA regular expressions. For example, specifying <i>demo(.*)</i> will match
all bidders that have 'demo' in their shard key.</b> The best way to find out what systems are
running is to issue the 1 (echo) and simply press CR. All of the bidders will answer. Then
you can simply issue the ECHO command to whatever bidders you would like using the wildcard feature</p>

                <p>You can also use REDIS to send the bidder(s) commands to add
                campaigns, delete campaigns, start the bidder, stop the bidder
                and retrieve statistics. Each command is a JSON string. Look in
                the package com.xrtb.commands for examples on the actual
                command formats. However, here are the basics. The bidders
                listen on the 'commands' topic, and return values on
                'responses' topic. Each of the commands and their responses may
                have additional fields. Here are examples</p>

                <p>The echo command retrieves status information about a
                bidder's state. All of its campaigns are listed, as well as
                some summary statistics. The class implementing this is
                <i>com.xrtb.commands.Echo.java</i>. An example echo response
                from the Commander program can be seen below:</p>
                <pre>
     
$java -cp "libs/*" tools.Commands
RTB4FREE Commander
(1=Echo, 2=Load JSON Database into REDIS, 3=Delete Campaign from REDIS,
4=Stop Campaign, 5=Start Campaign, 6=Start Bidder, 7=Stop Bidder,
8=Exit Commander)
