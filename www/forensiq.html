<h2>Protecting Yourself from Fraudulent Bid Requests</h2>
<p>RTB exchanges are chock full of garbage sites spewing out fake bid requests waiting for you to waste your money on. In this post I will
show you where to learn about fraudulent practices, and how to protect yourself. Don't bid on garbage ads. We have seen exchanges that have as high as 50% bogus
bogus traffic on it. Don't be get cheated.</p>

<h3>Tricks of the Trade</h3>
<p>There has been a lot of talk about the pervasive amount of click fraud and bot traffic happening in digital. 
Marketers are reportedly spending anywhere from 30% to 70% of their digital budgets 
on fake impressions and clicks</p>
Here's a short list of nasties out there scamming for your ad dollars:
<ul>
<li>Crowdsourcing (Cyclops): Thousands of users are recruited and paid just to view an article, providing page views 
(and extra cash) to the hacker. In these cases, the users are unaware that they are performing fraudulent activities.</li>

<li>Incentivised Ad Networks (Voldemorts): Individuals are given incentives like reward points, gift cards or Bitcoins 
to read an article or to view/click on an ad. They may know they are doing something wrong but abide by a “don’t ask, 
don’t tell” policy.</li>

<li>Click Farms (Zergs): These are organised groups of individuals who are paid to click. They use a 
combination of mobile devices and SIM cards to perform fraud online and repeatedly change their devices 
and networks to evade detection. They are called Zergs (just like in StarCraft) and operate in big groups with a 
malicious intent.</li>

<li>Computer Malware (VaderBots): Highly sophisticated and difficult to catch, VaderBots are masters of disguise. 
Thousands of PCs infected with malware (also known as bot slaves) work in conjunction with a bot master to perform 
smart fraud online. The bot master decides which sites the slave accesses and which ads it views and clicks so its 
actions appear to be random and to come from the computer of a “real person.”</li>

<li>Sophisticated Fraud (PhantomBots): This type of bot travels around the web to visit websites, view ads and 
click using a fairly sophisticated algorithm. Think of it as a digital ghost that is always boosting numbers.</li>

<li>Retargeting Fraud (DeceptiBots): This bot can mimic a human’s intentions, such as an interest in a specific brand of c
ar. Ads targeted to a particular niche result in a higher CPM than untargeted ads. DeceptiBots deceive advertisers 
into believing they are receiving valuable, targeted clicks.</li>

<li>Mobile Simulator (CryptoBots): A mobile simulator on a computer that mimics a smartphone running mobile apps, 
CryptoBots are used to perform fraud on in-app mobile ads while their real identities remain hidden.</li>

<li>Ad Stacking: This is the practice of placing multiple ads on top of each other in a single ad placement. Even though 
the “stacked” ads are invisible to the person visiting the page, they often reported as viewable to 
the advertiser, so the fraudster gets paid.</li>

<li>Toolbars: While browser toolbars have legitimate uses, they are sometimes exploited by fraudsters. 
Bad actors distribute branded toolbars as part of software bundles that are often times installed without the user’s 
knowledge. They hijack the user’s browser, reset the default search engine and enable a platform for serving ads. 
The new default search, will usually mimic a well known search engine and can be extremely difficult to uninstall.</li>

<li>Ad injection: Usually masked as “deal finders” for online shoppers, these programs will inject unauthorised ads on 
legitimate web pages. Like toolbars, this software is usually distributed in software bundles and will install without 
the user’s knowledge.</li>

<li>Domain Identity Theft: A fraudulent seller hard codes a publisher domain into an ad unit. The ad runs on different publisher that commands a lower price. The buyer thinks their ad ran on the intended domain and somehow they got a deal (i.e., got the ad below market value) Neither the publisher or advertiser know that they’ve been defrauded.
<p>Now, mobile phones have become part of the botnet menace. Millions of phones are infected with apps that do nothing
but send fake requests for impressions. The user never sees the ads, and they run constantly in the background, robbing
the advertiser of their impressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 100s of mobile apps out there that are nothing more than botnets - making rtb bid requests, and displaying ads in the background.
The poor user has no idea their phone is a bot, running constantly, draining their battery and your bank account. There could be millions
of phones running these bots 24x7 and the owners have no idea it's happening. These new mobile bots are a real threat to RTB. <i>We have seen traffic
on some networks that are as high as 50% fraudulent!</i></p>
<p>

<h3>Stopping the Madness with Forensiq &trade; </h3>
<p><a href="https://forensiq.com" target="_blank">Forensiq &trade;</a> provides a service for identifying online mobile device hijacking. Check out their study on
ad fraud - its a real must.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is get a Forensiq &trade; API key. <a href="https://forensiq.com/contact/" target="_blank">Contact Forensiq and obtain the API key first</a>, then configure RTB4FREE to 
toss out bid requests that are bogus.
<hr/>
<h3>Configure RTB4FREE with Forensiq &trade;</h3>
<p>Now that you have your key, the startup JSON file for RTB4FREE needs to be configured to use the Forensiq &trade; key. The standard startup
file is Campaigns/payday.json. The following shows the beginning part of the startup file. Right after the <i>seats</i> object is the
<b><i>forensiq</i></b> object definition.

<pre>
{
	"seats": [
	{
		"name": "atomx",
		"id": "atomxseatid",
		"bid": "/rtb/bids/atomx=com.xrtb.exchanges.Atomx"
	},
	{
		"name": "smartyads",
		"id": "smartypants",
		"bid": "/rtb/bids/smartyads=com.xrtb.exchanges.Smartyads"
	},
	{
		"name": "nexage",
		"id": "99999999",
		"bid": "/rtb/bids/nexage=com.xrtb.exchanges.Nexage"
	}, {
		"name": "privatex",
		"id": "5555555",
		"bid": "/rtb/bids/privatex=com.xrtb.exchanges.Privatex"
	}, {
		"name": "fyber",
		"id": "seat1",
		"bid": "/rtb/bids/fyber=com.xrtb.exchanges.Fyber"
	}, {
		"name": "smaato",
		"id": "seat1",
		"bid": "/rtb/bids/smaato=com.xrtb.exchanges.Smaato"
	}],
</pre>
<b>
<pre>
	"forensiq": {
		"threshhold": 64,
		"ck": "your_key_goes_here",
		"endpoint": "http://api.forensiq.com/check",
		"bidOnError": false

	},
	.
	.
	.
</pre>
</b>
<p>The <i>"threshhold"</i> attribute shows the maximum risk you are willing to accept on a bid request from the exchange. If Forensiq reports greater than 64% probability this
is a fraudulent bid request, the RTB4FREE bidder will NOT consider this request. Set this value based on the amount of risk you
want to accept.</p>
<p>The <i>"ck"</i> attribute is the value of the key you obtained from Forensiq.</p>
<p>The <i>"endpoint"</i> attribute is the Forensiq enpoint.</p>
<p>The <i>"bidOnError"</i> attribute identifies whether you want to bid anyway if an error is encountered contacting the Forensiq service.</p>
<p>This is all you have to do to knock out those pesky bots trying to steal your impressions</p>.
