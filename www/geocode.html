<h2>Selling ads based on Zipcodes, states, counties, and cities - all from GPS Coordinates in Bid Request</h2>
<p>It would be great to be able to programmatically sell ads based on a list of zipcodes, or states, counties
and cities. However, usually this information is not available in the bid request - the exchange just doesn't 
give it to you. However, if your bid request object has a lat/long in it - RTB4FREE can do a pretty good job
of converting the coordinate into this very useful information.</p>
<p>First there is a text database of unique zipcodes by GPS centroids located in ~data/unique_geo_zipcodes.txt. Then
these is another text database of zipcodes and the associated state, county, and city for each zipcode.</p>
<p>When RTB4FREE starts, these two databases are stored in memory as two hash maps. Then when the bid request comes
in, if it has lat/long located in the object <b><i>device.geo</i></b> then this can be used to locate the zipcode using the Haversine algorithm.
Once the zipcode is obtained, it is used as a key into the location hashmap to retrieve the State, county, and city record
for that location.</p>
<p>As for campaigns wishing to use this extended geo information, there is a new extended object added to the bid request
called <i>rtb4free</i>. One of the child objects is <i>geocode</i>. The <i>rtb4free.geocode</i> object has the following
attributes:
<pre>
	code
	city
	state
	county
</pre>
<p>Using the lat long of 42.378,-71.227 in a bid request will cause the bid request <i>rtb4free.geocode</i> to have the following
attributes assigned to it:<p>
<pre>
	code: 2152
	state: MA
	county: Suffolk
	city: Winthrop
</pre>
<p>Now the next thing to do is to create a campaign that can use this capability. For example purposes, say
you are selling a product only in the states of California, Massachusetts, or New York. In the "attributes"
section of the campaign, specify the extension to the bid request as:
<pre>
	{
		"bidRequestValues": ["rtb4free.geocode.state"],
		"value": ["MA","GA"],
		"op": "EQUALS"
     },
	{
		"bidRequestValues": ["rtb4free.geocode.code"],
		"value": [2152,2153,2154,31017,31018],
		"op": "MEMBER"
     },
</pre> 
<p>In the above campaign, the RTB4FREE bidder will bid on any request from Masachusetts zip codes 2152, 2153, and 2154 and
Georgia zipcodes 31017 and 31018.</p>
