<h2>What Exactly is MRAID</h2>
<p>We won't reiterate what MRAID is, you can read about it here <a href="http://www.iab.net/mraid" target="_blank">, 
but we think it's useful to understand what MRAID look like in an RTB setting.</p>
<p>MRAID is all about advertising in a mobile <i>application</i>, versus in a web page. That's not to say there isn't a web page
involved, it's just that the browser is built into the mobile application. In the case of an Android application, the ad is displayed
in a "WebView" container. This container is (on the Android) a Java class that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Think of MRAID ads as banner-ads on steroids. MRAID ads offer much more capability than a regular banner ad, and can actually
implement a lot of functionality on their own, and can even integrate with the mobile device's hardware, like the camera.And yes, 
you can do video in MRAID. However video with MRAID is possible, but you can't 'click' on the ad in any meaningful way, so it's not 
that useful. If you want a video ad, it's better to use a video player with VAST</p>
<p>To understand an MRAID ad served by RTB, consider the following ad that is served up in a Win Notification:<.p>
<CODE>
</CODE>
<p>As you can see the Win Notification is returning an almost complete web page, including a considerable amount JavaScript. The 
banner is located in the DIV's named 'normal' and 'expanded'</p>This ad will expand when the user clicks it, and provides access to 
SMS, the Camera, the telephone, etc. Here's what the ad looks like normally: XXXXXXXXXXXX and here, expanded. XXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>The markup includes the JavaScript needed to support the expanded functions. Notice for example the function
handling XXXXXXXX. This XXXXXXXXX function is making a call to mraid.xxxxxxxxxxxx. The mraid object is the MRAID API</p>
<p>The MRAID API JavaScript interface is loaded at the very first line of the ad markup with the familiar:
<XMP>
<script src="mraid.js'></script>
</XMP>
<p>This looks like an ordinary browser loading a library; this is not the case. Instead, the 'mraid.js' is being loaded into a Java WebView 
object, that implements a web browser. It is the mraid object providing the API, and inside the mraid, object, to communicate with
the actual mobile device, the AdWebView object is used. Look here for an example:
<CODE>
mraid.playVideo = function(url) {
	AdWebView.playVideo(url);
}       
</CODE>
<p>The mraid API is called by the ad, and it is the AdWebView is a Java object, and provides the interface to the actual
mobile device. To sum it up, your ad markup will include a script reference to mraid.js. Then, your ad will provide the HTML for the banner
and all the JavaScript functions needed to implement your enhanced banner ad. The API will provide you with the enhanced MRAID capabilities.</p>
by interfacing to the Java WebView object that implements the browser for the mobile application.</p>
<p>RTB4FREE provides a rudimentary JavaFX WebView that runs an 'app' which displays an MRAID ad it retrieves from RTB4FREE.com. You can find
obtain the source code here: <XXXXXXXXXXXX>.
<p>You can run the mobile app by running ant:</p>
<code>
$ant mraid
</code>
<p>The mraid app will make a request to the RTB4FREE Private Exchange, which will then work with RTB4FREE RTB to retrieve an MRAID
ad. The mraid app will print the markup returned from the Private Exchange and play the ad on the screen.</p>The application is only
a couple of files, so it should be fairly easy to follow.</p>
