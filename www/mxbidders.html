<h2>Running Multiple Bid Engines, Especially for Geo-centric Applications</h2>
<p>Volume is the name of the game in RTB bidding. In the case of GEO-centric bidding, it is imperative that you process as many bid
requests as you can, as only 20% of the bid requests will contain GEO tags.</p>
<p>So, if you plan to base your RTB strategy on geo centric ad spend, you will really need to handle the volume. If you need 1000 bids
a second to make your ad-spend on a geo based campaign a success, you will need to handle 20,0000 bids per second at a 5% win rate, But, if only
20% of the bid requests contain GEO tags, then you will need to process 100,000 bids per second to fully spend on your campaign.</p>
<p>As you can see, running multiple bidders is going to be a requirement</p>
<h2>Load Balancing</h2>
<p>Running multiple bidders will require you to load balance among multiple bidding machines. However, you should make sure you are not accepting more
connections from the exchange than your bidders can handle. But note, simply refusing the N+1 connection from the exchange is not recommended.
The refusal will count against your bidder and enough refusals will cause the exchange to close it's connections and lock you out for a while,
usually around 15 minutes. Instead, your load balancer can accept the connection, send an HTTP 204 back to the exchange and then close the connection.</p>
<h2>Splitting Bid and Win Domains</h2>
<p>if you have your load balancer set up correctly, and it's sending HTTP 204 back when load is exceeded, there is one thing to watch out for: dropped win notifications</p>
If your load balancer is 204'ing 20% of the requests to prevent overload, then 20% of your win notifications are also being 204'ed.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you are paying for impressions that are not served. To prevent this, use a different URL for win notification
in the actual bid. In this way, you can direct your wins to a load balancer not overloaded, that balances traffic to just few bidders that
handle the win  notifications</p>
<p>Of course, the REDIS cache will still need to be connected to both domains to ensure the bidders handling the win notifications have access to the
bid data</p>
