<h2>Qualifying RTB4FREE With SMAATO</h2>
<p>RTB4FREE is easy to qualify with the SMAATO RTB exchange. Following these instructions you qualify your own implementation of RTB4FREE with
the SMAATO exchange in less than 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>Set Up Your SMAATO Account</h3>
<p>First you will need to obtain a <a href="http://dspportal.smaato.com/registration/register" target="_blank">SMAATO account as a DSP</a>. Of course, you need to get REDIS, WEBDIS, and RTB4FREE
set up to begin your bidding, <a href="details.html#QUICK" target="_blank">you can find instructions on that here.</a></p>
<p>You also need to tell SMAATO where your bid engine is, <h href="xxxx">tell them on this screen here.</a>
<p>You will be running two kinds of tests. One is the compliance test, which makes sure the RTB4FREE is correctly bidding and no-bidding on the 3 kinds
of ads that SMAATO supports: text, image, and rich media. Then, comes the accounting test. Once you have your account set up, <a href='http://dspportal.smaato.com/secure/index' target="_blank">go over to the
test page and get ready to test.</a> The test page looks something like this: <img src="smaato1.png"></img>. Make sure the OpenRTB request URL matches
your host id. For example, on host 199.188.86.5 it should look like http://199.188.86.5/rtb/bids/smaato</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Modify RTBidder.java To Handle Test Bids</h3>
<p>The test SMAATO campaign is already loaded by default from the Campaigns/payday.json file by default. However, you must modify com.xrtb.bidder.RTBServer.java
to enable the SMAATO test. Here is the code snippet:
<pre>
/************* Uncomment to run smaato compliance testing ****************************************/
/*Enumeration<String> params = request.getParameterNames();
String tester = null;
if (params.hasMoreElements()) {
	smaatoCompliance(target, baseRequest, request, response,body);
	return;
} */
/************************************************************************************************/
</pre>
When you are done, the code should look like:
<pre>
Enumeration<String> params = request.getParameterNames();
String tester = null;
if (params.hasMoreElements()) {
	smaatoCompliance(target, baseRequest, request, response,body);
	return;
} 
</pre>
</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Run the Compliance Test</h3>
<p>In a console window, now start RTB4FREE
<pre>
$ant xrtb
</pre>
<p>Now in the SMAATO test page, make sure they can see your RTB server by pressing the "Ping request URL host" first (Your RTB host
must be visible on the Internet, and ICMP is not blocked.), Once you are sure SMAATO can see your page, then press the compliance test. A
series of RTB requests are made, making sure the bidder doesn't bid on inappropriate items. Once you pass, you're on to the next step, "Auction Simulation"</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Run the Auction Simulation</h3>
<p>In the auction simulation SMAATO will make sure your numbers for bids, nobids, and cost accounting add up. For this test, you will also
use the example accounting system included with RTB4FREE. So open another console window on your RTB host so we can run that too.</p>
With the RTB4FREE bidder already running in the other window, start the accounting program SPARK, by typing:
<pre>
$ant spark
</pre>
The accounting program will start. As soon as it does, press the "Auction Simulation" on the SMAATO page and the auction begins. At the
conclusion of the auction SMAATO will present a form for you to fill out for Number of Bids, No Bids, and Wins and also the Cost of the Bids
and the Cost of the Wins.</p>
<p>Wait for the Spark program to run and collect all the statistics. They are collected immediately, but only print the stats after a minute or so. Once they 
are printed to the console take the data from the console window and put them in the SMAATO form. here's what the stats will look like:
<pre>
[java] ---------- HAMMER TIME -------------------
[java] -->request
[java] -->accounting
[java] -->bid
[java] -->pixel
[java] -->win
[java] -->click
[java] -->nobid
[java] -------------------- STATS ------------------------
[java] REQUESTS = 1000
[java] BIDS = 750
[java] NO-BIDS = 250
[java] WINS = 600
[java] PIXELS = 540
[java] CLICKS = 11
[java] BID COST = 750.0
[java] WIN COST = 529.007
[java] ----------------------------------------------------
</pre>
Transfer the number of bids, no bids, wins, bid cost and win cost to the SMAATO form and click OK. Now you are done!</p>
<p>Contact with your SMAATO account manager, set up your campaigns and start winning auctions.</p>
<h2>Set Up Your SMAATO Template for real</h2>
<p>Smaato uses an XML document in the ADM of the RTB bid response. The format of the template is a little different for SMAATO. Below you can see the template in the test SMAATO
campaign from database.json for the sample image based ad:
<xmp>
 "campaigns" : [ {
    "owner" : "ben",
    "adId" : "smaato-test",
    "adomain" : "originator.com",
    "template" : {
      "default" : "<a href='{redirect_url}/{pub}/{ad_id}/{creative_id}?url={campaign_forward_url}'><img src='{pixel_url}/{pub}/{ad_id}/{creative_id}/{bid_id}' height='1' width='1'></img><img src='{campaign_image_url}' height='{campaign_ad_height}' width='{campaign_ad_width}'></img></a>",
      "exchange" : {
        "mopub" : "<a href='mopub template here' </a>",
        "mobclix" : "<a href='mobclix template here' </a>",
        "nexage" : "<a href='{redirect_url}/{pub}/{ad_id}/{creative_id}?url={campaign_forward_url}'><img src='{pixel_url}/{pub}/{ad_id}/{creative_id}/{bid_id}' height='1' width='1'></img><img src='{campaign_image_url}' height='{campaign_ad_height}' width='{campaign_ad_width}'></img></a>",
        "privatex" : "<a href='{redirect_url}/{pub}/{ad_id}/{creative_id}?url={campaign_forward_url}'><img src='{pixel_url}/{pub}/{ad_id}/{bid_id}/${AUCTION_PRICE}/{creative_id}' height='1' width='1'></img><img src='{campaign_image_url}' height='{campaign_ad_height}' width='{campaign_ad_width}'></img></a>",
        "smaato" : "clickurl='{redirect_url}/{pub}/{ad_id}/{creative_id}?url={campaign_forward_url}'; imageurl='{campaign_image_url}'; pixelurl='{pixel_url}/{pub}/{ad_id}/{creative_id}/{bid_id}';"
      }
    },
    "attributes" : [ {
      "value" : "image/jpeg",
      "op" : "MEMBER",
      "notPresentOk" : false,
      "bidRequestValues" : [ "imp", "0", "banner", "mimes" ]
    } ],
    "creatives" : [ {
      "forwardurl" : "http://localhost:8080/contact.html?{site_id}&adid={ad_id}&crid={creative_id}",
      "imageurl" : "http://localhost:8080/images/320x50.jpg?adid={ad_id}&bidid={bid_id}",
      "impid" : "image-test",
      "w" : -1.0,
      "h" : -1.0,
      "attributes" : [ ],
      "price" : 1.0
    } ],
    "date" : [ 20130205, 20200101 ],
    "category" : [ "IAB1", "IAB2" ]
  }
</xmp>
<p>There are also example creatives for a text based ad and a richmedia ad, but the formats are basically the same</p>
<p>For SMAATO, the template.exchange.smaato value is set to a single like of Javascript, with variables used to set up the clickurl, the 
imageurl, and the pixelurl. Inside these strings you can set up desired format usingg the macro substitutions. Make sure you use proper Javascript!
</p>
<p>In the above example, you can see the clickurl is set to go to the RTB4FREE redirect, passing the pub, ad_id, and creative)id. The url field
is set to the actual campaign forward url. If you just wanted to just click straight to the ad simply specify the {campaign_forward_url} for 
the clickurl. The creatives[n].forwardurl will be substituted in. </p>
Not shown are the SMAATO variables for:  <i>tooltip, additionaltext, text,</i> and <i>javascript</i>, which are also available for use with SMAATO.
